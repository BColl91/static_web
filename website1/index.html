                <h2>Skills and Developments</h2>
                <p class="light">I have recently finished learning level 3 <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp">Python</a> (which was eye-opening) and have gained a certificate in Digital Skills Level 2. I'm hoping to get more comfortable with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_is_JavaScript">JavaScript</a> and build my confidence in working with others. I will be researching more on what skills and experience may be required to work in the industry.</p>

                <h2>Personal</h2>
                <p class="light">In my free time I am usually found playing various computer or PS5 games. I am currently on Final Fantasy: Rebirth on Ps5.. Hollow Knight on Steam... and at least 5 other games on switch! I also read some fantasy, sci-fi, horror and demonology books! I should be reading Gideon but my sister has lent me a korean horror book to skim through.</p>

                <h2>My targets and current progress</h2>
                <p>My ideal career change would be to work in developing games. With some experience in character design, a creative mind and hobby that is gaming, I believe I would enjoy building such a career.</p>
                <p>Alternatively, I have been given resources to learn data analysis. Some of the methods I have learned have been intriguing and confidence-boosting.</p>
                <p>I understand that I need to work on my communication skills more, I need to be more active on LinkedIn, Reaching out to others and showing what I can do is greatly beneficial.</p>
                <p class="light">Random Fact: I actually have an honours degree in Costume Making for Stage and Screen.</p>
