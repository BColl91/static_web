        <p>My teenage hobby and degree in Costume Making reminds me of some fun times where I learned decent life-skills along with boosting creativity and how to work with different strange and wonderful materials.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>I got to make Disney's Zorro, a rendition of Red Riding Hood, multiple periodic dresses, a *lot* of cloaks, some animal accessories, a full armor suit, and more! It was really fun helping build characters and making them come to life with the actors and models.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>You might be wondering what happened.. It is very difficult to get in the industry in both theatre and television. So I slowly lost interest as I worked other jobs. Along the way I was given a chance to learn more digital-based skills and a new perspective that showed I can work with another interest of mine: computers!</p>
